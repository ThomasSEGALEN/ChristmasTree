## Purpose of the work experience for the learner
To implement the skills acquired during our training by reinvesting what we learned in a professional situation in relation to a simple need: to design the Campus Academy Christmas tree.


## Campus Contest Calendar
17 and 18 December 2020.  


## Terms and Conditions 
In groups of two. Deliver collaboratively using GIT and by dropping your rendering on GitHub or GitLab for example.
The groups were generated randomly.
| Surname | Name | Promotion | Random |

## Background : Christmas Tree 
Christmas is approahing and animals have broken into Campus Academy's premises to steal Christmas trees.
Animals also celebrate Christmas with a tree and do not like it when humans cut down their trees.
Compassionate, the students have decided to do without Christmas trees from the forest. Super smart, they will use a 3D printer to get their tree.
For this, the Switch IT team is requisitioned to develop a program that will draw on the screen a Christmas tree.


## Achievement Criteria
- Your Python program must be executable with command lines:
Ex : python3 my_program.py
Same with arguments
Ex : python3 my_program.py argument_1
- Prohibition to add "hard" trees in your code
- The use of PEP8 and flake8 code style is strongly recommended.
- A strong appreciation will be added for a code in English(no variable name with accents etc...)
- For each Python3 program, a rendering of an algorithm is expected. Use the pseudo-code learned and/or any other form that allows the corrector to understand your approach.


## Expected deliverables : Team Workflow
With your partner, you must work in collaboration. For this, GIT is mandatory.
Please also make sure to deposit your code on GitHub.
Your project must include :
- Regular commits
- A clean and formatted README.md markdown file (French or English)
